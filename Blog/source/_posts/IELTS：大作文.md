## 范文

### 双边讨论

```english
Some scientists believe computers will become more intelligent than human beings. Some people think the development has a positive impact, while others think it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
```

With many scientists considering that computers will eventually outperform human beings, it has sparked a lasting debate over whether this development has a positive impact or is harmful to humanity. While I acknowledge its considerable benefits such as promoting efficiency and alleviating workloads, I also contend that it poses serious risks to human creativity and employment.

On the one hand, intelligent computers can substantially cut the time required for routine work. With the aid of various algorithms, humans can process vast volumes of data quickly and accurately, which took much longer by hand before, resulting in abundant free time for leisure and exercise. For instance, a recent study by a leading research team has found that students using modern computers complete the same text task twice as fast as those using machines from ten years ago, with significantly higher correctness and stability.

On the other hand, overreliance on advanced computers may undermine our own cognitive abilities and creativity. As individuals defer more decisions to technical models, they risk losing intellectual skills, internal motivation and original thoughts. Moreover, given that computers are capable of taking over complex assignments in the future, the number of positions will slump, while many jobs may even be eliminated and totally replaced by automation, leading to widespread unemployment and social panic. Consequently, people are about to suffer devastating economic setbacks and technology companies may be regarded as irresponsible and selfish for falling to mitigate family burdens.

In conclusion, although smart computers offer undeniable advantages in terms of productivity and pressure reduction, they also threaten to erode human creative capacity and job security. Therefore, only by embracing their capacity to address challenges and investing in lifelong learning can we ensure that we remain valued.

### 同意与否

```english
Some people believe that the best way to produce a happier society is to ensure that there are only small differences between the richest and the poorest members. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
```

It is often argued that narrowing the gap between the richest and the poorest can help create a harmonious society. I partially agree with this view, given that smaller differences do substantially promote social cohesion and alleviate individual anxiety, while other approaches such as expanding employment opportunities, increasing basic incomes and reducing regional disparities are also crucial for boosting overall satisfaction.

To begin with, it is proved that people tend to feel more secure and hopeful living in a community where their financial situations hover around the median income level. By contrast, those who regard themselves at the bottom of the income scale often experience a sense of frustration. Moreover, if individual economic differences are reduced or even eliminated, people are more likely to hold positive attitudes towards future setbacks, resulting in social solidarity and stability. These positive effects underscore why income compression matters.

Nevertheless, more essential measures must be underlined for addressing the root causes of social inequality. For example, evidence from the data released by the United Nations shows that the proportion of people who are satisfied with their own lives soared from 17% to approximately 80% in East Asia between 1999 and 2019, thanks to expanded employment programs and higher baseline incomes made by governments. Beyond these economic interventions, mitigating regional disparities also plays a key role, for this guarantees that both core cities and remote areas enjoy equal prospects for advancement, thereby making people feel valued.

All things considered, although reducing wealth inequality is a considerable step toward social harmony, it must be complemented by measures that empower the poor to improve their incomes and ensure equitable resource allocation. Only by combining such strategies together can we build a happier society in which everyone thrives.

### 利弊评价

```english
Lectures were used in the past as an old way of teaching a large number of students. As new technology is now available for education, some people suggest that there is no justification for lectures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
```

With advanced technology becoming increasingly available for education, it is argued that conventional lectures, which were once the standard method of teaching large classes, have outlived their usefulness. As for me, I partially agree with this view: although lectures struggle to attract students and offer no means of review, they still play a vital role in real-time interaction and are more cost-effective.

On the one hand, lectures are often criticized because if students miss a single point, they may be confused about the following content, with no way to revisit it. By contrast, videos on modern online platforms allow students to replay lectures at any time and in any place. Moreover, student concentration cannot be neglected, since they tend to get distracted by peers sitting next to them. One of the most significant disadvantages of lectures is that their format is so limited that there is hardly any innovation or creativity, leading to boredom and disappointment among students. These drawbacks indeed explain why many hold negative attitudes towards lectures.

On the other hand, lectures still have irreplaceable benefits that should be underscored. For instance, they provide an excellent opportunity for students to interact with teachers, as questions can be answered instantly on the spot. In addition, online lessons require access to expensive computers or smartphones, whereas lectures simply require physical presence. By comparison, lectures are far cheaper than modern technology, thereby promoting equality and fairness. Furthermore, when we consider efficiency, it is notable that students often learn more in offline lectures than in online sessions. A recent experiment by a leading research group found that students who attended a lecture in a school hall scored significantly higher on a subsequent test than those who viewed the same lecture online at home.

In conclusion, while lectures have undeniable shortcomings, certain benefits such as immediate interaction and cost savings cannot be replicated by purely advanced technology. Therefore, it is necessary to retain lectures, provided we can fully utilize their distinct strengths.

Science tells us some activities are good for our health, and there are some unhealthy activities. But millions of people still do those unhealthy activities. Why? What can we do to change this situation?
```

Even though scientific research has proved that certain habits such as smoking, excessive drinking and overeating are harmful to human health, a great number of people keep engaging in those unhealthy activities. This trend persists primarily because they offer immediate gratification, provide an easy way to unwind and have become prevalent. Nonetheless, there are still some effective solutions, such as more standardized regulations and advertising slogans, to reverse the situation.

Turning first to the causes, many people prioritize the immediate pleasure over long-term well-being. For example, a sugary snack or a cigarette break deliver great amusement in a second, compared to regular exercise and healthy diets, whose effects are indirect, subtle and abstract. Moreover, social influences reinforce these harmful choices, since people suffering from peer pressure or family burdens barely have little way to relax themselves apart from drinking alcohol and overeating. Last but not least, such unsound activities are so common in social venues that people cannot help but participate in them or are easily persuaded to try some by others, although they may be reluctant at first.

To address these root causes, companies have to launch massive campaigns, incorporating graphic warnings and visible slogans to raise awareness. Furthermore, governments play a vital role in tackling the problems by implementing regulatory interventions such as higher taxes and stricter laws. With efficient implementation, people's attitudes towards lives will shift accordingly. As reported by the National Bureau of Statistics, the youth smoking rate fell from 20% to 7% within ten months in 2018 when the tobacco agency introduced more warning labels on the package and raised taxes by 10%.

In conclusion, many factors contribute to unhealthy lifestyles, and eliminating harmful behaviors requires more than individual willpower. Therefore, pairing impactful warning labels with robust regulations can encourage people to adopt more beneficial habits and subsequently improve public health on a broad scale.

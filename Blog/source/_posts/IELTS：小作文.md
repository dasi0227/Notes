The two given bar charts illustrate the students' main reasons for studing **across five age groups**, **as well as** the proportion of support received from employers, **including** time off and fee assistance.

> 两个子图，先用常规方法说明第一个子图，然后用 as well as 衔接第二个子图；比例可以用 the proportion of 表示；当有补充信息时，用 including 说明

Overall, **it is immediately apparent that** students under 26 study mainly for career, whereas those over 49 study primarily out of interest. Employer support **reaches its peak** among the youngest age group, while it **hits its low** in the 30–39 age group.

> 很明显的可以看出年轻人为工作学习，老年人为工作学习；雇主的扶持对最年轻的组别最多，但是对38-39的组别最少

**Turning to** the first chart, under-26s study **overwhelmingly** for career (approximately 80%), but **this share falls to 68%** in the 26-29 bracket and **further to** 55% in the 30-39 bracket. **Meanwhile**, interest-driven study **rises from 10% to 25% over the same age groups**. In the 40-49 range, both motives **stand equally at about 40%**, **before** those over 49 **reverse the trend**, with over 70% studying out of interest **compared to only** 18% for career.

> 26岁以下压倒性的是为职业学习；但是比例逐渐下降，而为兴趣学习的比例逐渐上升；到了40-49岁两种动机的比例持平；接着到了49岁以上出现了反转，将近70%的人为兴趣学习对比于只有18%的人为职业学习

**As for** employer support, it **peaks at nearly 70%** for under-26s, but **halved to around 35%** for 30-39s. It then **climbs slightly to 38%** in the 40-49 group and **reaches about 48%** for those over 49, **mirroring a pattern in which** support **is relatively high for** the youngest and the oldest.

> 在26岁以下到达峰值70%，但是骤降至一半35%在30-39岁；随后微微增涨到38%和48%；反映出雇主支持对年轻人和老年人更多

The bar chart compares the number of US households (in millions) **across five annual income brackets** in 2007, 2011 and 2015.

> across 类型范围，in 说明时间范围；把 US 直接作为 households 的修饰；用括号 (in millions) 补充说明单位信息。

Overall, the \$75,000-\$99,999 **remains the lowest** in all given years, while the \$50,000-\$74,999 bracket **merely experiences minor fluctuations**. Nevertheless, the other three brackets **maintain relatively high** throughout the period, **albeit to varying degrees**.

> 有一组在三年都是最低的，这显然是最显著的特征；有一组几乎没有什么波动，这个也是比较明显的特征；其他三个组有的先升后降，有的先降后升，但都是处于相对较高水平的，只是具体数目有所不同

**With regard to** households with the highest annual income, the number fell from 29 million in 2007 to 27 million in 2011, while **it subsequently soared to** 33 million in 2015. The \$25,000-\$49,999 bracket **reached its peak at** 30 million in 2011, **surpassing the other four brackets**, **before it decreased to** 28 million in 2015. **In contrast**, the \$50000-\$74999 bracket **remained almost unchanged at** nearly 21 million and the \$75000-\$99999 bracket **hovered around** 14 million over the period, making them the two smallest groups.

> 第五组先降后增；第二组在2011年到达峰值并成为五个组别中最多的；第三组和第四组则保持相对稳定

**Meanwhile**, those earning less than \$25,000 **presented an upward trend**, with 30 million in 2011 and 28 million in 2015 **compared to** 26 million in 2007. **Therefore**, the gap between the low income group and the middle income group **widened progressively** from 2007 to 2015. Although the gap between the low income group and the high income group narrowed in 2011 **relative to** 2007, it then **became even more significant**, reaching around 5 million by 2015.

> 第一组有上升趋势；因此低收入和中等收入的差距越来越大；但是和高等收入的差距先减小再增大

The three pie charts compare three types of nutrients, **namely** sodium, saturated fats and added sugars, **with regard to** four typical meals consumed in the USA.

> 大的类别是营养物质，小的类别是四餐；营养物质可以用 namely 仔细说明是哪三种；用 with regard to 关联四餐

In general, the three nutrients **account for similar proportions at** breakfast and lunch, whereas they **vary considerably at** dinner and snacks. Moreover, dinner **constitutes the largest slice of** both sodium and saturated fat, while the snacks **make up the largest slice of** added sugar.

> 营养物质在早餐和午餐的占比没有特别大的变化，但是在其他两餐却有显著变化；晚餐中钠和饱和脂肪的占比最多，而小吃中添加糖的占比最多

**Turning first to** sodium, dinner and lunch **together make up 72% of** total intake, with dinner **alone constituting** 43%, **over three times** breakfast’s proportion at 14%. In terms of saturated fat, dinner **again leads at** 37%, **followed by** lunch at 26%, while breakfast and snacks **split the remaining 35%**.

> 晚餐和午餐共同占据了钠的半壁江山72%；其中单独晚餐就占据了43%，是早餐的三倍14%；而饱和脂肪晚餐依旧领先37%，紧随的是午餐26%，早餐和小吃分剩下的35%

As for added sugar, snacks make up the biggest share at 42%, **overtaking** dinner, which accounts for only 23%, while lunch and breakfast constitute 19% and 16% **respectively**. Overall, dinner **dominates** nutrient consumption, whereas breakfast **consistently contributes the least**.

> 小吃占据添加糖的绝大部分42%，超过了晚餐23%；午餐和早餐各自分别占19%和16%；可以得出晚餐在营养物质中始终具有统治地位，而早餐一直是占据最小份额的

The six pie charts compare the percentage of water used across six world regions, **divided into three purposes**: industrial, agricultural and domestic use.

> 用 across 说明覆盖了多个区域；areas 可以用 regions 代替；每个区域都有三个相同的作用划分，可以用 divided into；如果类别较少，可以用冒号列出类别列表

Overall, agricultural use accounts for the largest share of water consumption in all regions **except** North America and Europe, where industrial use **predominates**. **In contrast**, domestic use **remains relatively low** across all six areas.

> 南美、非洲、亚洲农业用水最多；北美和欧洲工业用水最多；生活用水的占比在六个地方都普遍较少

It is immediately apparent that agricultural use **dominates** in Africa, Central Asia and South East Asia **at 84%, 88% and 81% respectively**, **significantly outpacing** other uses. In these regions, industrial use **ranges from 7% to 9%** and domestic use from 5% to 12%, **with their combined share never exceeding 20%**.

> 这三个地方农业用水是大头80%多，显著多于其他用途；工业用水和居民用水很少，而且合起来都不超过20%

In South America, agricultural use **still leads at** 71% although domestic use rises to 19%. **In contrast**, North America and Europe **experience a complete reversal that** industrial use constitutes the largest share at 48% and 53%, **followed by** agricultural use at 39% and 32%, and domestic use at approximately 14%.

> 在南美洲，农业用水依旧是头部，但是居民用水增加到了19%；相比之下，北美洲和欧洲是完全相反的情况，即工业用水占据主导，紧随其后的是农业用水，最后才是居民用水

The line graph illustrates participant numbers for five activities at a social centre in Melbourne, Australia, **at five-year intervals** between 2000 and 2020.

>the number of xxx 可以替换为 the xxx numbers for ...；如果是具体数值而不是比例，用 for 会比 across 贴切；如果时间具有相同间隙，可以用 at xx-year intervals between ... and ... 描述

Overall, participation in table tennis and musical performances **experienced a significant upward trend** between 2000 and 2020, whereas amateur dramatics **saw a sharp decline**. Film club and martial arts participation remained consistently high, **with the former** maintaining the highest participation levels throughout the period.

> 乒乓球和音乐表演呈明显的上升趋势；戏剧表演的人数大幅下降；电影的参与人数最高

Turning first to amateur dramatics, the number of participants **reached its peak at** 28 in 2005, **before plunging to** just 5 by 2020. **In contrast**, participation in table tennis **soared significantly** from around 16 in 2000 to over 50 by 2020, while participation in musical performances **climbed steadily** from virtually 0 in the early years to nearly 19 by 2020.

> 戏剧在2005到达峰值，随后一跌到底；相比之下乒乓球一路飞升，音乐表演也稳步提升

As for the film club, participation remained consistently high, **fluctuating between 60 and 70** over the period, **far outpacing the other activities**. Martial arts **likewise held constant at** about 30 to 40. Meanwhile, table tennis **overtook martial arts for the first time by a narrow margin** in 2015, whereas it **subsequently extended its lead to** approximately 10 by 2020.

> 电影俱乐部一直保持在较高水准，远超其他活动；武术也很稳定，但是在2015年第一次被乒乓球超越，并在2020年被拉开差距

The table compares the proportion of people living in poverty **by six family types** in Australia in 1999, **together with** the overall poverty rate across all households.

> by ... 表示根据类别划分；together with 表示并列关系；overall 表示整体信息

As a whole, sole parent families experienced the highest incidence of poverty, whereas aged couples saw the lowest poverty rate. Notably, half of the provided household types recorded poverty rates **above the overall rate**.

> 最高的是单亲家长，最低的是老年夫妇；一半种类超过了整体值

**Turning first to the lowest proportions**, only 6% of single aged people and 4% of aged couples lived in poverty, **both well below** the overall rate of 11%. **In comparison**, single people without children **recorded a much higher** poverty rate of 19%, while childless couples **stood at** 7%.

> 先看到最小比例，单身老人6%和老年夫妻4%的贫困率最低，远远低于整体贫困率11%；作为对比，单身的贫困率却高达19%，而无小孩夫妻在7%

**At the other extreme**, sole parents **had the highest incidence at** 21%, **exceeding** the overall rate by a wide margin. Although couples with children had a low poverty rate of 12%, **lagging 9 percentage points behind** sole parents, they **nonetheless comprised the greatest number of** individuals in poverty at 933,000, **roughly four times** the 232,000 sole parents.

> 另一个极端，单亲家庭的发生率最高为21%，远远超过了整体水平；尽管有孩子家庭的贫困率只有12%，低于单亲家庭9个点；但是他贫困人数933000却足足是单亲家庭的4倍232000

The two tables compare the sales (in millions of euros) of Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas in five European countries in 1999 and 2004.

> 单位一般标注在 sales, number, amount 的后面

Overall, both coffee and banana sales rose significantly in the UK and Switzerland between 1999 and 2004. Coffee sales **saw modest gains** in the other three countries, whereas banana sales declined slightly in Sweden and Denmark **by comparison**.

> 香蕉和咖啡在英国和瑞士的销量增加了；咖啡在其他三个国家也稍微增加了；但是香蕉在瑞典和丹麦却小幅度减少了

Turning first to coffee, sales soared from 1.5 million in 1999 to 20 million in 2004 in the UK, **an increase of over tenfold**. Meanwhile, sales in Switzerland and Belgium also **doubled**, while sales in Denmark and Sweden both rose slightly by 0.2 million. In general, all five countries saw sales growth, **albeit to varying degrees**.

The first pie chart illustrates the **distribution** of dance classes **by** location in a town in Australia, **while** the second bar chart presents the **number** of students **in** three dance genres **for** two age groups.

> 比例分配可以用 distribution，数量用 number；按照xxx手段来划分用 by，在xxx类别之中用 in，针对xxx范围用 for；地点信息通常放在第一个主句中

Overall, the pie chart reveals that private studios **account for the largest proportion of** dance classes location, while college-based studios **comprise the smallest**. The bar chart indicates that younger students **incline to** ballet most, **followed by** tap and modern, whereas the older students **show the completely opposite preference**.

> 饼图说明最大比例和最小比例；柱状图说明两个完全相反的选择倾向

Turning first to location, private studios constitute the largest slice at 48%, twice the proportion of school halls at 24%, **with their shares combined** accounting for **approximately three-quarters of** all classes. Community halls account for 18%, followed by college-based studios at 10%, lagging 38 percentage points behind private studios.

> 私人工作室占据了最大份额48%，是学校礼堂的两倍24%；他们一起占据了接近四分之三；社区礼堂占据了18%；最后是大学工作室占据了10%，落后于私人工作室38%

As for the types, ballet **dominates the preference with** over 600 students, **outpacing** tap and modern at 440 and 300 respectively. In contrast, **student figures experience a complete reversal** among students aged 11 to 16, with modern soaring to over 500 and ballet slumping to below 300, while tap drops slightly by roughly 20 participants.

> 小孩中，芭蕾统治了选择600，远超踢踏舞的440和现代舞的300；相反，青年人中现代舞骤增至500多，芭蕾骤降至300下，tap轻微减少了20

The two maps present **a comparison of** the layout of Porth Harbour in 2000 and its current form, highlighting notable changes in **land use** and **infrastructure**.

> 用 current form 代替表达 layout nowadays；land use 和 infrastructure 是宏观描述

Overall, the harbour has been **extensively redeveloped**, with new cafés, shops, showers and toilets **added in the south**, while the disused castle **has been transformed into** a hotel. It is also apparent that the marina and the fishing boats **have swapped positions**.

> 南部新咖啡馆、商铺、浴室和厕所；废弃堡垒改造为酒店；码头和渔船交换位置

In 2000, the harbour **featured** only a single block of showers and toilets in the northwest, with a marina and a dock **immediately to its right**. Below these were the car parks and fishing boats. There was a narrow road that **ran from** the main road to the lifeboat, **beyond which stood** a disused castle and a public beach.

> 港口在西北部只有一块给淋浴和厕所的区域，然后就是港口和码头在它的右边；在区域下面是汽车公园和渔船；一条窄路从主干道通往救生船，在远处则是废弃城堡和公共沙滩

Currently, a new shower and toilet section has been added between the two car parks. **One notable change is the relocation of** the marina and fishing boats, whereas the lifeboat and the dock **still remain in their initial positions**. Additionally, cafes and shops have also been constructed to the left side of the lifeboat. The road, **which no longer leads to** the car park, **now extends to** the hotel that used to be a castle, thereby converting the **adjoining** public beach into a private one.

**Currently**, several factories line both sides of the eastern road, while the other factories **are situated around the central roundabout**. A river to the north **separates the industrial area from the farmland beyond**, whereas no road connects the two sites, **leaving them isolated from each other**.

> 一些工厂排在道路两侧，其他工程在环岛周围；一条河分割了农场和工业区；没有路连通他们，是彼此隔离

**Under** the future plan, various new infrastructure will be introduced, including shops and a medical centre at the heart of the town, as well as a playground and a school in the east. Notably, all **existing** factories will **be replaced by** housings, which will extend northward and westward, bringing these new residential buildings much more **adjacent to** the town and river. In addition, a new straight road is planned to be built **from the center across the river to the northern edge**, where further housing will be constructed, with farmland lying immediately to its right.

The diagram illustrates **the process of** producing a biofuel called ethanol.

Overall, the manufacturing process consists of several distinct stages, **commencing with** plant cultivation and culminating in ethanol production. **Furthermore**, the carbon dioxide emitted by vehicles runnning on ethanol **is then recycled to** support plant growth.

> 乙醇的制作是一个完整的流程；随后被使用产生的二氧化碳能够被植物吸收利用

At the first stage, sunlight and carbon dioxide are absorbed by trees to drive their growth. The crops are then harvested by tractors and transported to a pre-processing facility. Next, **a specialised machine is responsible for** crushing and grinding the raw materials into cellulose, **followed by the processing stage where** a combination of physical and chemical methods is used to extract sugars. 

> 首先被树吸收然后被拖拉机丰收，运到预处理设备；专门的机器会负责碾碎，接着是一系列化学和物理变换

Afterwards, with specific microbes added, these sugars are converted into ethanol. **Once the transition is complete, the resulting** biofuel is collected and bottled for use in cars, trucks and planes. **However, the process does not end here but continues as** the carbon dioxide emitted by vehicles **is released into the atmosphere**, which is subsequently captured and reused by plants, **thereby forming a closed-loop system**.

> 一旦转换完成，就会被用作燃料；然而，过程并没有终止，而是会被排放出去到大气层；最后被植物吸收重新利用

The two diagrams show the processes **involved in** producing cement and **subsequently** using it to **manufacture** concrete for building purposes.

Overall, the cement making process consists of several distinct stages from limestone and clay to cement packaged in bags, while the concrete production simply **blends cement with** other raw materials **in the appropriate proportions** in a rotating mixer.

> 水泥是线性流程；混凝土则是按比例混合

Turning first to cement production, limestone and clay **are fed into** a crusher, where they **are ground into** powder, **followed by blending in a mixer** for further combination. Next, a rotary machine is responsible for heating up the mixture at high temperature as well as tumbling it constantly. **Once the former processes are complete**, the resulting clinker is grinded by a mill to produce the final cement, which is then **packaged in bags for distribution**.

> 先被喂入压碎机，然后放入搅拌机，接着放入旋转加热器；最后放入碾碎机制作成水泥，并包装分发

As for concrete production, the cement **previously produced**, together with water, sand and gravel, **is combined in a concrete mixer in precise percentages**, with cement, water and sand accounting for 15%, 10% and 25% respectively, and gravel constituting the remainder. Finally, the concrete **is ready for** building after thorough mixing.

> 先前制作的水泥和其他原材料按照精确比例进行混合，最后搅拌得到的混凝土可以用于建设
